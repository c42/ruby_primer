title - Find the frequency of a string in a sentence

.section :find_word_frequency, "Find the word frequency in a given sentence", 113
  %p
    Given a sentence containing multiple words, find the frequency of a given word in that sentence. 

  %p
    Construct a method named 'find_frequency' which accepts two arguments 'sentence' and 'word', 
    both of which are String objects. 
    
  %p
    <strong>Example:</strong><br/>
    Given 'Ruby is The best language in the World' and 'the', 
    should return 2 (comparison should be case-insensitive). 
  
  %p
    <strong>Hint:</strong> You can use the method <code>Array#count</code> to count the frequency of 
    any element in the given array. eg:
    %pre
      [9,3,4,9,5].count(9) 
    Will return the value 2
